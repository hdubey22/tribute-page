            <p>Neerja Bhanot was an Indian flight purser. She was the Senior Flight Purser on Pan Am Flight 73 which was hijacked by four terrorists from the Abu Nidal Organisation on 5th September,1986 after it made a stopover at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi,Pakistan. She spoiled the plan of the hijackers of flying the plane to Cyprus by alerting the pilots about the hijack without delay. After a tussle of around 17 hours when the hijackers opened fire on the passengers, Neerja immediately opened the emergency exit and started helping people escape. She was shot dead while saving 3 children from the bullets.</p>
